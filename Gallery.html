    <!--intro about flowers and their significance-->
    <P>
    Flowers carry a lot of importance in our lives. Ancient literature in India is replete with names of various flowers. Flowers are considered auspicious and they are also an integral part of Hindu worshipping. In India, no worship of God that is considered complete without adding colourful, vibrant and fragrant flowers. But it is not just any flower that is offered to any deity, rather, each flower holds a different significance and thus chosen to be offered to a particular deity. This is what makes them sacred today and gives them a religious appeal. Devotees make a garland of flowers to dedicate it to God. In addition, we also use flowers for special occasions like festivals and weddings.Learn about the significance of the flowers in my garden below:

    <p>
      <h3>3.Shuli</h3>
      The Parijat tree which bears lovely white flowers with an orange stem was planted in the abode of Lord Indra. This tree was part of the gifts received during the Samudra Manthan, or the churning of the ocean, and was a celestial plant, not found on earth. When Krishna‚Äôs wives Satyabhama and Rukmini each expressed a desire to have the tree exclusively to herself, the Lord set an example of the perfect balancing act.Satyabhama want to posses the tree and Rukmini it's flowers. So Krishna planted the tree in such a manner that though it grew in Satyabhama‚Äôs house, its flowers would fall in Rukmini‚Äôs courtyard. Thus, the Parijat tree story became a symbol of how Krishna divided his love equally among his wives.
      Sprinkling of these flowers from trees mark the arrival of winter. Mostly they bloom in october which is the time for Navaratri. Fresh flowers were added to kheer and some were sun dried to be used as a substitute for saffron for sweets.So it's also called THE POOR MAN'S SAFFRON. Apart from flowers these leaves also have medicinal values treating for various types of fever, arthritic knee pain, sciatica, dry cough, diabetes,etc.
      They also have anti‚Äëallergic, antiviral and antibacterial properties.

      Garlands, flowers or petals ‚Äì marigold or ‚Äògenda‚Äô is one of the most celebrated flowers in Hindu mythology, rituals and festivals. The uniquely layered flowers with golden glowing blooms send out positive vibes in the surroundings even though they do not have a distinct fragrance. The orange/saffron color depicts renunciation, and hence, it is offered to gods and deities as a symbol of surrender. Marigold is often used on the occasion of Vijayadashmi, to signify trust in the Divine and the will to overcome obstacles, just like Lord Ram defeated Raavan. 
      Marigold(sthulapushpa in Sanskirit) has a stout stalk, which symbolises the trust in the divine. Also, its saffron colour is known to be the symbol of surrendering to god. It's distinct fragrance is known to ward‚Äëoff stress and negative thoughts. Marigold flower has natural anti‚Äëinflammatory and anti‚Äëcancer properties. These ornamental flowers also act as a natural insect‚Äërepellent, as its fragrance keeps mosquitoes and bugs away.
